# Memo

A new Flutter project.

## Problem Statement

Being Human, it is natural to forget. As a result, sometimes certain important works may be forgotton due to the busy and hectic schedule. Hence, it may result in some sort of Loss either in business, Jobs or any other important aspect of life.

## Proposed Solution

Here is an app constructed to solve the above stated problem. It has features where it's users can write important stuffs in the notes and in order to get reminded about any sort of work then they could use Alarming feature.

## Overview of App

App consists of three tabs or pages- Home Page, Notes, Reminding Alarm. Firebase is used as a backend to store the data provided in the Notes section by the Users. Gradient Effect is used to give better Graphic Interface to the App. Splash service is also used.
